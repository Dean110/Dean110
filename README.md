I have a love of nachos that inspired me around 2015-2016 to create a nacho power rankings website. I had devised a rating scale that factored in multiple criteria to try to objectively determine where the best place for nachos were in Columbus. At that time Condado Tacos was on top of the leaderboard with their $5 bowl of nachos, but a post pandemic reset needs to occur. I also want to leverage my own skills for web development instead of using WordPress.

Maintaining this site is what gave me some confidence that I knew what I was doing with web development; helping convince me that I was capable of going into software development for my second career.

<summary>Figuring out how to leverage <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github CodeSpaces</a> to make the process of learning how to be a professional developer more accessable to all.</summary>

I went to a coding bootcamp to learn software development and later returned to the bootcamp as an instructor. While there I worked with GitHub to be become one of their Campus Advisors. GitHub has some fantastic tools for educators that help manage assignments: giving students their own repositories for assignments based on a template, automatically grouping students into teams on team projects, and allowing for grading feedback through pull requests.

One of the challenges I saw as an instructor was that not every student started at the same place in regards to experience or resources. One of my students had a laptop that was given to her by a family member that was woefully under powered for a modern IDE and would constantly face issues because their developer environment was not setting them up for success. I am interested in working with GitHub again to figure out how to use their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">CodeSpaces</a> product to help provide a cloud based solution to provide a development environment that can be used on a Chromebook or even a tablet. This can help lower the barrier of entry for potential students of software developers, providing them an equal footing with the other students in regards to their development environments.
